# Patient & Medication Management System

## Description
This Swift program allows you to manage patients and their medications effectively. It includes features such as tracking patient information, managing prescribed medications, and determining blood type compatibility for transfusions.

## Features
- **Patient Management**:
  - Create and store patient information (e.g., name, age, height, weight, blood type, sex).
  - Calculate a patient’s age and display their full name in a formatted string.
  - Identify compatible blood donors based on a patient’s blood type.
  - Calculate patient BMI

- **Medication Management**:
  - Add medications to a patient and track their details (e.g., name, dosage, frequency, duration, and route of administration).
  - Filter medications based on administration routes (e.g., "by mouth").
  - Check which medications are currently active and expired.
  - Handle errors for duplicate medication prescriptions.
  - Extend the duration of medication

- **Blood Type Compatibility**:
  - Determine blood types that a patient can safely receive in a transfusion.
